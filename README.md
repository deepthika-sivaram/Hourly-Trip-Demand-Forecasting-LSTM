# Hourly Trip Demand Forecasting using LSTM

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast hourly trip demand using historical time series data. The model is designed to capture temporal dependencies in the demand pattern and predict future values with improved accuracy.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis on hourly trip data.
- Prepare time series sequences for LSTM input.
- Design and train an LSTM neural network for forecasting.
- Evaluate the model using MAE, RMSE, and visualizations.
- Generate and visualize future trip demand predictions.
